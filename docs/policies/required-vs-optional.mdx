# Required vs Optional Fields

:::success Supply Information

You should *always* strive towards supplying as much (and correct) information as possible.

:::

## Required Fields

<RequiredField />

There are some fields, we *simply cannot be without* and this depends on which file format and entity (offer, promotion, product) you are working with. 

You can find the required field for each respective fileformat and entity in the sidebar under the respective `<Entity> Feed / File Formats / <Format> / Required Fields`


The following fields are required for an offer to show, you can see an example of the minimal required fields in action [here](/examples/offer/minimal)


## Optional Fields

<OptionalField />

Most fields in Prisjakt are optional, which means that you donÂ´t have to supply them. Your offer will be indexed anyway. Please note that this *may limit the functionality* we can present for your offer. You can find detailed information of each field in the sidebar under `<Entity> Feed / Fields / <Field>`
