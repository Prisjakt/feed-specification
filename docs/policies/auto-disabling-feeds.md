# Auto Disabling Of Feeds

If a feed is unreachable (or empty) over an extended period of time (we retry multiple times) our system will automatically disable this feed from being ingested again. If the feed is automatically disabled **a notification of the problem will also be sent** to you as a shop owner.

:::info tip
You can use our [Business Center](https://support.prisjakt.nu/sv/collections/3088260-prisjakt-business-center) in order to [investigate the problems](https://support.prisjakt.nu/sv/articles/6556994-validering-av-produktfeed). Once you have corrected the errors, you can then re-enable the feed for ingestion.
