# Required Vs Optional Fields

## Required Fields

<RequiredField />

There are some fields, we *simply cannot be without* such as a link to your offer, a price and an image. If any of these fields are missing, your **whole offer** will be omitted.

The following fields are required for an offer to show

- [Availability](/docs/fields/availability)
- [Condition](/docs/fields/condition)
- [Id](/docs/fields/id)
- [Link](/docs/fields/link)
- [Price](/docs/fields/price)
- [Title](/docs/fields/title)
- **At least one of**: [Product Type](/docs/fields/product_type) OR [Google Product Category](/docs/fields/google_product_category)

## Optional Fields

<OptionalField />

Most fields in Prisjakt are optional, which means that you donÂ´t have to supply them. Your offer will be indexed anyway. Please note that this *may limit the functionality* we can present for your offer. You should *always* strive towards supplying as much (and correct) information as possible.
