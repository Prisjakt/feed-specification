# Required vs Optional Fields

## Required Fields

<RequiredField />

There are some fields, we *simply cannot be without* such as a link to your offer, a price and an title. If any of these fields are missing, your **whole offer** will be omitted.

The following fields are required for an offer to show, you can see an example of the minimal required fields in action [here](/examples/offer/minimal)

- [Availability](/fields/offer/availability.md)
- [Condition](/fields/offer/condition.md)
- [Id](/fields/offer/id.md)
- [Link](/fields/offer/link.md)
- [Price](/fields/offer/price.md)
- [Title](/fields/offer/title.md)

## Optional Fields

<OptionalField />

Most fields in Prisjakt are optional, which means that you donÂ´t have to supply them. Your offer will be indexed anyway. Please note that this *may limit the functionality* we can present for your offer. You should *always* strive towards supplying as much (and correct) information as possible.

## Promotion Required Fields

<RequiredField />

There are some fields, we *simply cannot be without* such as a link to your offer, a price and an title. If any of these fields are missing, your **whole offer** will be omitted.

The following fields are required for us to correctly index your promotion and assign it to offers.

- [Promotion Id](/fields/promotion/promotion_id.md)
- [Long title](/fields/promotion/long_title.md)
- [Coupon value type](/fields/promotion/coupon_value_type.md)
- [Promotion effective dates](/fields/promotion/promotion_effective_dates.md)


## Promotion Optional Fields

<OptionalField />

Optional fields don't have to be supplied, but it's still good to have them.

- [Description](/fields/promotion/description.md)
- [Image link](/fields/promotion/image_link.md)
- [Promotion page link](/fields/promotion/promotion_page_link.md)
