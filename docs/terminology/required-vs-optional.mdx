# Required vs Optional Fields

## Required Fields

<RequiredField />

There are some fields, we *simply cannot be without* such as a link to your offer, a price and an title. If any of these fields are missing, your **whole offer** will be omitted.

The following fields are required for an offer to show, you can see an example of the minimal required fields in action [here](/examples/minimal)

- [Availability](/fields/availability.md)
- [Condition](/fields/condition.md)
- [Id](/fields/id.md)
- [Link](/fields/link.md)
- [Price](/fields/price.md)
- [Title](/fields/title.md)

## Optional Fields

<OptionalField />

Most fields in Prisjakt are optional, which means that you donÂ´t have to supply them. Your offer will be indexed anyway. Please note that this *may limit the functionality* we can present for your offer. You should *always* strive towards supplying as much (and correct) information as possible.
