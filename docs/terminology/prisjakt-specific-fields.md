# Prisjakt Specific Fields

## Offer feeds
Most fields in use in our feed are also part of the [Google Product Data Specification](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/7052112?hl=en), and as such these fields will be usable for other systems that support Google Product feeds.

But in order to be able to provide you with extra functionality we sometimes add extra fields that can be used for an even better experience at Prisjakt for your customers.

Currently, our Prisjakt specific fields are:

- [prisjakt_id](/fields/offer/prisjakt_id.md)
- [member_price](/fields/offer/member_price.md)


The fields are also defined in [our xml namespace](/types-of-feeds/file-formats/xml.md#namespaces)
