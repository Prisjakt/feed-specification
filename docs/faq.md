  <summary><strong>How does the Prisjakt Feed relate to Google Merchant Product Specification?</strong></summary>
    

Prisjakt feed specification is compatible with [Google Merchant](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/7052112?hl=en) feeds. This means that if you have a Google Product feed, it can be used as a Prisjakt feed. In most cases the opposite is also true, you can use a Prisjakt Feed in systems that supports Google Product Feeds (although we do support some extra fields they may not be used by the other system).
