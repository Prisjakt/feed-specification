# Product Feeds

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />
```

Product feeds are a way for manufacturers to provide us with detailed product data for the products they create. 
This data is used to create a product catalog that can be used to create product listings on the site. 

:::note

**Product feeds** are sometimes also called **manufacturer feeds** but they have the same intent and purpose.
