# Google Manufacturer XML

## Description

The [Google Manufacturer Product Data Specification](https://support.google.com/manufacturers/answer/6124116?hl=en&ref_topic=7663870,&visit_id=638095616516154262-3704335796&rd=1) is supported directly by Prisjakt. But as the `product_detail` field is vaguely defined we have extended the format into our own [Prisjakt Manufacturer XML format](../prisjakt_manufacturer_xml/index.md) that should be preferred.
