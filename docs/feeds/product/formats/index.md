# Product File Formats

:::info

While we support a number of file formats, we recommend using the format based on your use case as follows

- For books, it's likely that your system is already capable of generating the industry standard [Onix format](./onix/index.md)
- For appliances, the [TradeXML](./tradexml/index.md) is the best format as it uses the EU standardized PI format
- In all other cases (and for the greatest precision and flexibility) you should use the [Prisjakt Manufacturer XML](/feeds/product/formats/prisjakt_manufacturer_xml/index.md) as it is an extension of the [Google Manufacturer XML Format](./google_manufacturer_xml/index.md)
