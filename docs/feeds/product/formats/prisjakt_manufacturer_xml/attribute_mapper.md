# Attribute Mapper

This tool helps in mapping your product attributes to Prisjakt's taxonomy via the [product_detail](/feeds/product/fields/product_detail.md) field. Select all attributes that you want to send to us to generate example field values, then include them **for each product item** in your feed. You can see a full feed example [here](/feeds/product/formats/prisjakt_manufacturer_xml/index.md#full).
