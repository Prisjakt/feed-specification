There are multiple ways to get your price offerings into Prisjakt and which one you should choose depends on the size of your shop, how frequent you wanÂ´t to update and other properties.

In general these methods can be categorized as follows:

- **Pull based** where we fetch offers from you on regular intervals or when changes are detected
- **Push based** where you send offers to us when something changes
- **Integrations** are pre-made integrations and plugins for different e-commerce systems that you can use to supply your inventory
