## Pull vs Push

There are multiple ways to get your price offerings into Prisjakt and which one you should choose depends on the size of your shop, how frequent you wanÂ´t to update and other properties.

In general these methods can be categorized into two categories:

- **Pull based** where we fetch offers from you on regular intervals or when changes are detected
- **Push based** where you send offers to us when something changes
