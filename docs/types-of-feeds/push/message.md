# Message Protocols

:::caution Proposals

Push based methods are not yet supported but are being considered, please contact us if you are interested in these ways of delivery and would like to be a pilot.

:::

In this approach you would send a message to us via a queue system on each change of your offers.

## Advantages

- Direct updates of offers
- Efficient data handling (less data processed, better compression on protocols)

## Disadvantages

- Would require deep integration with your shops system
