# XML

[XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) stands for e**X**tensinble **M**arkup **L**anguage. It is very similar to HTML except it doesn't have any predefined tags. In a way it's a meta languge that allows to create own markup language which then can be used to store and share data.

## Use CDATA

Using [CDATA](/docs/advanced/encoding/cdata) is recommended for fields containing unstructured strings in order to avoid encoding and escaping issues.
