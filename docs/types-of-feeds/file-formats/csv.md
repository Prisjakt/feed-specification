# CSV

[CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) stands for **c**omma **s**eparated **v**alues. It is a simple format very similar to spreadsheet. It should contain header and delimiter that is unique character not used anywhere in the feed content. CSV format is not fully standarized. This create all sorts of issues when working with product feeds.
