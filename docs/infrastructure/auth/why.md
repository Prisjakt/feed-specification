# Why Use?

Sometimes you wan´t to limit the traffic to your feed or allow only certain actors (like Prisjakt) to access your data. We support that you publish you feed with authentication and provide us credentials so that our agents can access your feed.

:::info We use dynamically assigned ip´s
We do not support a configuration where you allow only certain ips. Our agents are cloud based and spin up and change after load, hence they get dynamically assigned ip addresses that vary.
