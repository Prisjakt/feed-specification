# Quickstart

In this section we will walk you through setting up delivery of some offers to us in a simplified manner. This is intended to get you aquainted with terminology and our process.

:::info Quickstart is not best practice

This is one of the simplest and quickest ways to get results from our feeds, but itÂ´s not the way we [recommend](/docs/overview/best-practices) you to do it!
:::
## Steps

1. Right click  [this link](pathname:///examples/min-sample.csv) and choose **Save Link As** to get the minimal CSV file example

2. Import into a Google Spreadsheet

   ![Add offers](@site/docs/assets/guides/quickstart/google-spreadsheet-add-products.png)


4. [Make the spreadsheet accessible for everyone](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/183965?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop) the **public** URL of the spreadsheet

   You now have a publically hosted spreadsheet with your offers!

5. Get a CSV export of your spreadsheet by changing the spreadsheet URL
   - Copy key from spreadsheet URL (key is part after `/d/`)
   - Paste key to following URL `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/`**{key}**`/gviz/tq?tqx=out:csv`
   
   Your new feed url should look like this `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sny8zoEuBKCdUkn88ay6kB3gjvH0RBQZo6fGXnS542c/gviz/tq?tqx=out:csv`

6. Add URL you created in step 5 to [Business Center](https://support.prisjakt.nu/sv/articles/6175300-hantera-produkt-feeds-i-business-center) and use the shared url as feed url
