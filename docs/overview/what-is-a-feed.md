# What Is a Feed?

A product feed is a way for you as a shop to give Prisjakt structured information about your inventory so that we can present you products in the best possible way on our site. Most often, a feed consists of a single file in either [XML](/advanced/xml/index.md) or [CSV](/advanced/xml/index.md) [format](/feeds/offer/formats/index.md).

Please see our [getting started guide](./getting-started.md) and [minimal examples](/feeds/offer/formats/prisjakt_xml/index.md#minimal) in order to create a small feed which you can add to your shop in [Business Center](https://support.prisjakt.nu/sv/collections/3088260-prisjakt-business-center).
