# Escaping

**Escaping** is where you use special characters to treat the following characters in a different way within a given string. For a more in depth explanation please see [this StackOverflow Question](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4354301)

This is different then the process of [encoding](../encoding/index.md) where you transform all data in a specific way.
