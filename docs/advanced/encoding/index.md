# Encoding

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />
```

Somewhat simplified: **encoding** (of strings or binary data) is the process of transforming the data between different representations (UTF-8, XML Entity encoding, etc.). For a more in depth explanation please see [this StackOverflow Question](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4354301)

This is different then the process of [escaping](../escaping/index.md) where you use special characters to treat the following characters in a different way within a given string.
