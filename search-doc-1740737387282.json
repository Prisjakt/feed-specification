Please see our web server configuration section for recommendations. Potential things to investigate if the error is recurring is: Web server timeout settingsWeb server logsCache configuratinsAnti bot systems danger run_already_started This ingestion run is already running. This error might happen due to retry policies trying to start a run multiple times and you should wait for the run to complete. danger invalid_feed_format The format of the feed does not match the supported format (eg. you cannot configure a feed to use our Prisjakt XML but then send a Prisjakt CSV). danger invalid_encoding If the encoding of the file is anything else than our supported encodings this error is thrown. Please see our encoding section for details. danger process_encoding_error We process your feed in chunks, this error is thrown mid-processing if we are unable to decode the next chunk. danger sample_decode_error When reading your feed we sample some initial bytes in order to detect file encoding and csv format.

You can use different tools to validate this. Possible things to investigate Is there a valiud XML header tag to start withAre all XML elements properly closedAre all XML elements properly encodedAre namespaces used correctly danger offers_to_remove_above_threshold_error This error is caused by our safeguard. To make it harder to delete the full inventory of a feed we have a safeguard setting (default 30% of offers) that can be adjusted on a per feed basis.
